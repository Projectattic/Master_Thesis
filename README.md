# Master Thesis Code

The code is run from the terminal simultor.py file. 

The dwell time prediction accuracies to be tested, initial congestions, and AIs to be run, as well as the number of replicate tests for a scenario can all be edited in the "edit these" section of the file. 

The dimensions of the terminal, as well as the number of containers to add and the timescale of the tests can also be edited there. 

There are two flags, generate_tests, and run_tests that determine whether or not new test scenarios will be generated and whether or not tests will be run on the generated scenarios. This allows for independent scenario generation and test running.
